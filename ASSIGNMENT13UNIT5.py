"""
=====================================================================
 MULTIPLE THREADS PERFORMING DIFFERENT TASKS CONCURRENTLY
 Tools used : threading.Thread, threading.Lock, join(), time.sleep()
=====================================================================
IN PLAIN ENGLISH:
 Think of a kitchen with three cooks. One chops vegetables, one boils
 rice, one makes tea. They all work AT THE SAME TIME, so dinner is
 ready in the time of the SLOWEST job, not the sum of all three.
 A thread is one "cook". Our program starts several threads, each
 doing a DIFFERENT task, waits for all of them to finish (join), and
 uses a Lock so that two threads never scribble in the shared
 notebook (the results list) at the same moment.
